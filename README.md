# I build desktop tools and engineering utilities. 

## Either out of need or out of spite.

Most of my projects are pragmatic tools written to replace bloated software, cloud-first nonsense, and tools that actively get in the way of doing actual work. They exist because I needed them, used them, and eventually got tired of pretending the existing solutions were “fine”.



## Notable Tools
- [**Modbus RTU Tester**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/ashs-modbus-tool) – Debug Modbus devices locally without vendor software, serial terminal archaeology, or blind faith.
- **PDF Manipulator** – Merge and split PDFs without Adobe, Java, subscriptions, or spiritual compromise.
- **Video Converter** – FFmpeg GUI for converting videos without memorising flags or naming files `final_v7_REAL_THIS_ONE.mp4`.
- **Image Converter** – Convert images between formats, resize them sensibly, and generate ICO files without opening Photoshop or questioning your life choices.
- **Cable Tray Calculator** – Calculate cable tray fill, weights, and sanity without spreadsheets, guesswork, or site arguments that start with “it should be fine”.


## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- Local-first
- No cloud dependencies
- No subscriptions
- No telemetry
- EXEs included where it makes sense
- Source always available

Build from source if you want to feel morally superior.  
Double-click the EXE if you want the tool to open and do its job.
