I build local-first desktop tools and engineering utilities.

Most of my projects are pragmatic tools written in Python and PyQt, designed to replace bloated software, cloud-first nonsense, and tools that actively get in the way of doing actual work. They exist because I needed them, used them, and eventually got tired of pretending the existing solutions were “fine”.

## Selected Tools
- **Modbus RTU Tester** – Debug Modbus devices locally without vendor software, serial terminal archaeology, or blind faith.
- **PDF Manipulator** – Merge and split PDFs without Adobe, Java, subscriptions, or spiritual compromise.
- **Video Converter** – FFmpeg GUI for converting videos without memorising flags or naming files `final_v7_REAL_THIS_ONE.mp4`.

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- Local-first
- No cloud dependencies
- No subscriptions
- No telemetry
- EXEs included where it makes sense
- Source always available

Build from source if you want to feel morally superior.  
Double-click the EXE if you want the tool to open and do its job.
