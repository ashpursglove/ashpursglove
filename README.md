# I Build Engineering Utilities and Desktop Tools

## Either Out of Need or Out of **Spite**

Most of my projects are pragmatic tools written to replace bloated software, cloud-first nonsense, and tools that actively get in the way of doing actual work.  
They exist because I needed them, used them, and eventually got sick of subscribtion "professional" software being worse than what I can do myself.



## Notable Tools I'm Pretty Chuffed With
- [**Modbus RTU Tester**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/ashs-modbus-tool) – Debug Modbus devices locally without vendor software, serial terminal archaeology, or blind faith.
- [**Construction Cost Calculator**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/ashs_construction_calculator) – Construction cost calculator for engineers who prefer arithmetic and logic over optimism and don’t enjoy being gaslit by spreadsheets.
- [**Video Converter**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/ashs_video_converter) – FFmpeg GUI for converting videos without memorising flags or naming files `final_v7_REAL_THIS_ONE.mp4`.
- [**Image Converter**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_Image_Converter) – Convert images between formats, resize them sensibly, and generate ICO files without opening Photoshop or questioning your life choices.
- [**Cable Tray Calculator**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_Cable_Tray_Calculator) – Calculate cable tray fill, weights, and sanity without spreadsheets, guesswork, or site arguments that start with “it should be fine”.
- [**PDF Manipulator**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_PDF_Manipulator) – Merge and split PDFs without Adobe, Java, subscriptions, or spiritual compromise.


## Usual MO (Non-Negotiable)
- Local-first
- No cloud dependencies
- No subscriptions
- No telemetry
- EXEs included where it makes sense
- Source always available

## Build from source if you want to feel morally superior.  
## Double-click the EXE if you want to actually get the fucking job done.
