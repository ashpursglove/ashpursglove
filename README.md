## Either Out of Need or Out of **Spite**

Most of my projects are pragmatic tools written to replace bloated software, cloud-first wanky-ness and tools that actively get in the way of doing actual work.  
They exist because I needed them, used them and just got sick of subscribtion "professional" software being worse than what I can do myself or costing an arm and a leg to do basic functions.



## Notable Tools I'm Pretty Chuffed With
### Engineering Tools
- [**Modbus RTU Tester**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/ashs-modbus-tool) – Debug Modbus devices locally without vendor software, serial terminal archaeology, or blind faith.
- [**Construction Cost Calculator**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/ashs_construction_calculator) – Construction cost calculator for engineers who prefer arithmetic and logic over optimism and don’t enjoy being gaslit by spreadsheets.
- [**Cable Tray Calculator**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_Cable_Tray_Calculator) – Calculate cable tray fill, weights, and sanity without spreadsheets, guesswork, or site arguments that start with “it should be fine”.
- [**Engineering Drawing Maker**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_engineering_drawings) – Turn images and PDFs into proper ISO-style engineering drawings without AutoCAD, SolidWorks, licence servers, or a multinational claiming custody of your own work.
- [**OBJ Viewer**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_OBJ_Viewer) – Preview OBJs, bake lighting, and render clean turntable animations to MP4 or GIF. No cloud, no accounts, no Blender pilgrimage.
- [**STL to OBJ Converter**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/STL_to_OBJ) – A local STL → OBJ converter with batch drag-and-drop, vertex welding, mesh cleanup, and basic transforms. No cloud, no accounts, no Autodesk
### Media Tools
- [**Video Converter**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/ashs_video_converter) – FFmpeg GUI for converting videos without memorising flags or naming files `final_v7_REAL_THIS_ONE.mp4`.
- [**Image Converter**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_Image_Converter) – Convert images between formats, resize them sensibly, and generate ICO files without opening Photoshop or questioning your life choices.
- [**PDF Manipulator**](https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_PDF_Manipulator) – Merge and split PDFs without Adobe, Java, subscriptions, or spiritual compromise.




## Usual Gist of My Programs
- Free to use, available to everyone
- Local-first
- No cloud dependencies
- No subscriptions
- No telemetry
- EXEs included where it makes sense
- Source always available

## Build from source if you want to feel morally superior.  
## Double-click the EXE if you want to actually get the fucking job done.

## Pull Requests
If you want to help out the projects and update, bugfix etc please feel free to send pull requests. I do have a day job so apologies if it takes me a while to get round to reviewing and merging your code. Will give full credits in the ReadMe to anyone who makes my code less janky!
